## About Joe

I pride myself in efficient teamwork, exciting innovation, and diversity & inclusion. In order, to make any product or services successfull, one needs to have a great team, in which, eveyone can execute on their responsiblities and be able to be held accountable with each other. Therefore, in the positions i've held so far, I always make sure to communicate clerarly with my team, in order, to divide tasks and execute in a defined timeline. Whem it comes to Innovation, I'm always looking for new ways to make a new process faster or reduce work required, initiate the use of new technology, or simply bring new ideas to the table. As a 1st generation Mexican-American, since college to now, I've always been involved in creating the space for understanding, accepting, and valuing people of diverse cultures and backgrounds with a concentration in LatinXs
