## About Joe

I pride myself in efficient teamwork, exciting innovation, and diversity & inclusion. In order, to make any product or services successfull, one needs to have a great team, in which, eveyone can execute on their responsiblities and be able to be held accountable with each other. Therefore, in the positions i've held so far, I always make sure to communicate clerarly with my team, in order, to divide tasks and execute in a defined timeline. Whem it comes to Innovation, I'm always looking for new ways to make a new process faster or reduce work required, initiate the use of new technology, or simply bring new ideas to the table. As a 1st generation Mexican-American, since college to now, I've always been involved in creating the space for understanding, accepting, and valuing people of diverse cultures and backgrounds with a concentration in LatinXs

## AEC Virtual Hackathon
**Participant; July 2020**
_Innovation & Teamwork_

During quarantine, my friends & I participated in a week long AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) hackathon an created a preliminary solution for an everyday problem we see on a construction site, which is tracking and logistics of construction equipment. We created a preliminary UX design and managed to retrive live data (constant langitude & longitude) from a programmed GPS device that was sent to a cloud system. Overall, we ended up pitching the solution to a panel of judges from the Venture Capitalist side. We ended up not winning this competition, but there's always more.

## Patient Specific Bionic Hand
**Reasearch & Development Engineer**
_Innovation_

I had the chance of designing and prototyping a bionic hand for a 7 year old patient, who was born with an abnormal condition on their left arm prohibiting full growth of the left hand. For this project, I 3D scanned the patient's right hand to create a 3D object file to be manipulated. Afterwards, I exported that file into Creo to mirror the 3D object into a left hand. I designed a dynamic linkage system for the fingers and hollowed out the inside of the hand for the linear actuator to contorl the fingers. The linear actuator was controlled by an arduino from the electromyography signals recevied from muscle movement, in this case from the forearm. Overall, I got an initial prototype running up until I had to move on to the next portion of my career.
